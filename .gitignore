# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.global_ignore
# (note: this is set automagically when you install/update SBRC)
#
# If you want to add entries to this file that aren't Chopin-specific
# then please consider adding it to:
#
# https://github.com/simplybusiness/sbrc/blob/master/.global_ignore
#
# first, to see if it fits.
